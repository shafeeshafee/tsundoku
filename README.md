## Inspiration

## What It Does

Tsnundoku is a library for any type of books avaible at the users finger tips. We have a main Landing page that diplays users with the current and Best selling books. The application has an integreted search bar, allowing users to search for books as they please.

We approached this idea for our indivual appreciation to Discover new books, and our lifelong desire to learn new things.

This experience aligns with our personal ambitions as software engineers, front and backend engineers, and UI/UX engineers.

## How We Built It

This project was conceptualized by building wireframes and prototypes using Figma. We then built our project over 2 weeks. We used ReactJS, React Native and TailwindCSS, and Redux.

## Challenges We Ran Into

## Accomplishments

We hope to accomplish the following in a short period of time:

- Implement Redux into our project
- Architecting a complete project in a short period of time.
- Overall team synergy and cooperation.
- All the awesome work we collectively invested.

## What We Learned

We learned the following very quickly:

- Accessing & Navigating Google API
- Tailwind.CSS

## What's Next

We are looking foward to many new opportunities in the near future, including;

- Collaborating on User authentication
